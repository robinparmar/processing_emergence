# processing_emergence

This is an algorithmic visualisation inspired by Larry Cuba.

Created for the music video "Emergence" from Mai's album "Polis"
(released on Wormhole World in March 2021). 

Steps:
1. Create a folder emergencePlayground to hold these three sketches.
2. Place a sound file in the same folder (or a sub-folder).
3. Explore different parameter combinations using these keys:
   - =    decrease / increase cell offset
   0      reset cell offset to default
   [ ]    previous / next algorithm

I then created a second version of this sketch, using only the desired variants.
This facilitated a live visual improvisation to accompany the music.
